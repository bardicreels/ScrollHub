# Sand.Scroll.Pub

This repo powers the sand.scroll.pub server, where anyone in the world can instantly launch a new (ephemeral) website powered by Scroll.

The purpose of this site is meant to allow people to try and learn Scroll without installing anything on their machine.

The server is erased every hour.
